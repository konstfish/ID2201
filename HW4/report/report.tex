\section{Introduction}

% Summary of the work you've done, what are the topics we cover in this seminar, etc
% What is the main topic related to distributed systems covered in this seminar?
% Why is it important?

\section{Implementation}

% TODO: subsections for each gms version, major features/steps taken ending with ACKs

\subsection{}

%reliably: if a correct node delivers a message, all correct nodes deliver
%the message.
%The last statement seems to be a bit weak; what do we mean by a correct
%node?

\subsection{}

%Run some experiments and see if you can make the workersâ€™ state out of
%sync. What is happening?

\subsection{}

%Can we keep a group rolling by adding more nodes as existing
%nodes die?

% TODO: yes, just need the new leaders PID. Tested accross multiple machines with classmates

\subsection{}

%How would we change the implementation to handle the possibly lost
%messages? How would this impact performance?
% !!! ->  In the report, shortly explain your changes and discuss how this would impact performance.

\section{Main problems and solutions}

\subsection{Given Modules}

% TODO: understanding of the given modules & how the entire system is meant to work, what we're measuring/trying to implement

\subsection{Incrementing}
The problem: When a slave ignores a message, it still increments its sequence number N+1, but it never sends the acknowledgment.

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{What could possibly go wrong}

% The second reason things will not work is that we rely on the Erlang
% failure detector to be perfect, i.e., it will never suspect any correct node for
% having crashed. Is this really the case? Can we adapt the system to behave
% correctly if it does make progress, even though it might not always make
% progress?

% The third reason things do not work is that we could have a situation
% where one incorrect node delivers a message that any correct node will not
% deliver. This could happen even if we had reliable send operations and
% perfect failure detectors. How could this happen, and how likely is it that
% it does? What would a solution look like?


% Did you find any specific problem with the development of your solution?
% How did you solve it?

\section{Conclusions}

% What have you learnt from the problem presented?
% Was it useful?
