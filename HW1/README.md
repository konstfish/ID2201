Develop a web server and access it using a regular web browser.

In this assignment, you will build a small web server described in the following specification. It sounds more complicated than it is. Before the reporting session, you should have started with Erlang and completed a small web server. You have to do some performance measurements and write a report describing your experiments and findings.

You should complete the rudimentary server described above and do some experiments. Set up the server on one machine and access it from another (or the same) machine. A small benchmark program can generate requests and measure the time it takes to receive the answers. Write up your findings in a small report. At the corresponding reporting seminar, you must present and demonstrate your homework results and discuss your findings and problems (if any), the pros and cons of your solution, and suggestions on improving the server.
