In this homework assignment, you are required to implement a distributed hash table, as described in the specification below. Your implementation should follow the Chord scheme. To understand what you're about to do, you should have a basic understanding of Chord and preferably have read the original paper  (find below a link to the Chord paper).

The task is to implement the distributed hash table to the point where you have added the store and done some smaller experiments (sections 1 and 2). Write up your results and experience in a report and hand it in at the corresponding reporting seminar.

Specifically for this homework, be prepared to build a small ring (DHT) and discuss how to handle possible failures.
